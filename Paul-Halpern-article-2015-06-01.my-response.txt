We might not be able to survive indefinitely while also continuing to live, but we could transcribe the sum of our knowledge to a single photon. After all, a single qubit can hold an arbitrary amount of information in the amplitudes of its two basis vectors. The fact that the information is not subsequently accessible doesn't really matter - after all, it's the end of the Universe, so what've got to lose? So, here's my recipe for passing a message into eternity: We encode the sum of our knowledge in the amplitudes of two orthogonal polarizations of a single photon (or we can make many, many, many copies of this information with as many photons as we can get our hands on), and we set the photon on a path away from everything that is gravitationally bound. This ensures that it will never interact with anything ever again, because everything else in the Universe will be moving away from it at a speed greater than the speed of light.

Let's scale this up a bit. Is a photon truly our only choice? Can we send, saaay, an electron on such a path and encode the sum of our knowledge in its spin state? An electron will also end up in a coherent quantum state if the rest of the Universe is moving away from it at a speed greater than the speed of light. After all, what source of decoherence would it be exposed to?

What about a hydrogen atom?

The bottom line is this: As the Universe expands, and especially as the expansion accelerates, small objects can with increasing ease be placed on trajectories that will cause them to be perfectly protected from any interaction with other objects. This means simultaneously two things: their temperature will eventually reach absolute zero, but they will also be in an eternal coherent quantum state, safe from any source of decoherence.

So, to my untrained eye it would seem that such an environment is at least sufficient to inaccessibly inscribe the sum of our knowledge, but perhaps it's sufficient for more than that? Is it sufficient for constructing a machine that could at some future time consume a photon without being destroyed by such an interaction and at the same time use the energy to formulate another thought? Considering the wide range of photons that could interact with the machine, it would seem that the capability of supporting such an interaction is inexorably tied to the possibility that the machine is destroyed by some variation of such an interaction. On the other hand, building such a machine in the full knowledge that no photon will ever arrive is itself an expression of one of our most striking qualities: we hope.

Another implication of inscribing the sum of our knowledge and passing it into eternity: Somewhere, in some inaccessible way, the fact that you still owe some tuition will be recorded for all eternity. Gulp!
